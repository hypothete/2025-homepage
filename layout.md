## Art

* Went to school for painting and art history

* Some recent paintings, paint markers from photos

Grid of some recent pieces and couple older things

## Writing

I came out as trans in 2022, and since then I've been writing essays about my experiences in transition. I use my writing as a way to engage with queer theory, history, and media in order to better understand myself and what it means to be trans. [humankibble.com]

## Play

* I make stickers for sticking and shirts for wearing, here are some pics but I'm not selling any atm
* I used to build a lot of fun things with microcontrollers, like NTSC signal generators and robots that can play a Nintendo 3DS
* I'm obsessed with Minecraft and have run a number of servers for friends. It's my way of microdosing cloud architect life
